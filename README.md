# Sales-Analysis

From the dataset of 12 months, the sales of a business were analyzed using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas and visualized them in graphs and charts. Some questions were answered such as:
Sales for every month - In which month the sales were high - What products were sold the most together - In what hour the sales were on peak
